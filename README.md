# REDUX

This is a repository where I discuss the fundamentals of Redux. This tutorial will teach you "how Redux works" as well as why these patterns exist.

Please note that this tutorial intentionally shows older-style Redux logic patterns that require more code than the "modern Redux" patterns with Redux Toolkit that we teach as the right approach for building apps with Redux today. The purpose is to explain the principles and concepts behind Redux, rather than to provide a production-ready project.

After this introduction to the fundamentals, I'll teach you how to use "modern Redux" with Redux Toolkit.

I hope this is helpful!
